# Const and Let

Const and Let are variable types. Both have their advantages and dis advantages.

## Const

Const variables can neither be redefined or redeclared.
They are block scoped and can only be accesed in the block they are dexlared in (like an if statement.).

## Let

Let variables can't be redefined either but they can be redeclared during execution.
They are also block scoped.
